To uninstall Homebrew from your MacBook Pro via the terminal, you should use the official uninstall script provided by the Homebrew team.

Open Terminal: Navigate to Applications > Utilities > Terminal or search for it using Spotlight (Command + Space).

Run the Uninstall Command: Paste the following command exactly as it appears and press Enter:

Bash

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
Follow the On-Screen Prompts:

The script will list the files and directories it plans to delete.

Type y (and press Enter) when asked for confirmation.

You will be asked for your administrator password (your Mac login password). Note: As you type your password, nothing will appear on screen (no dots or stars). Just type it blindly and press Enter.

Remove Leftover Files (Optional): The script may warn you that it couldn't remove certain directories (like /usr/local/var/) because they contain non-Homebrew files. If you want to completely remove everything related to Homebrew and are sure you don't need those files, you can remove the Homebrew directory manually.

For Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs:

Bash

sudo rm -rf /opt/homebrew
For Intel Macs:

Bash

sudo rm -rf /usr/local/Homebrew
Verify Uninstallation: Type the following command to confirm Homebrew is gone:

Bash

brew --version
If successful, the terminal should return an error saying command not found: brew.

**** important links to run the python .py file in terminal or VSCODE**** it will not work with "home-brew" on MAC OS Terminal
